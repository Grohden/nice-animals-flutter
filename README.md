# nice_animals_flutter

A nice flutter application.

## Why this?

I was curious about how much work would take to rewrite [nice animals](https://github.com/Grohden/nice-animals/) using flutter,
i need to see how different flutter is from the standard ~~bad designed~~ android API

## Notes

* I'm still writing this, is not ready yet, but i can say that i loved how easily was to make the screens so far.
* I'm amazed by the live reload...
